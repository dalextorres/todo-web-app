## About

This website was created to test my Ruby on Rails and web development skills. After reading the Ruby on Rails book by Michael Hartl and creating the tutorial application that mimicked Twitter, I decided it was time for me to create something on my own. I chose a todo webapp because it was an easy task and it helped me practice CRUD operations. After this project, I felt that my RoR foundations where much better and it helped me understand many things that I did not get in the book. 

## Versions
This project uses Ruby 3.0.0 and Rails 6.0.3.4.

## Setup
The first step is to clone this git repository to your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexTorres88/todo-web-app.git
```

After that, in the project's root folder run:

```
bundle install
```

Now you can see your page running the next command in the terminal: 

```
rails server
```

You might have to run:

```
rails db:create
```

or 

```
rails db:migrate
```

before running rails server.

## Hosting
This webpage is not being hosted at the moment. 
## Database 
The project uses PostgreSQL as it's main database.
